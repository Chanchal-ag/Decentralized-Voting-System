# Decentralized Voting System

## 📝 Project Description
The **Decentralized Voting System** is a blockchain-based voting platform developed using Solidity. It ensures transparency, security, and tamper-proof electoral processes by leveraging smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To revolutionize the traditional voting process by creating a secure, decentralized, and transparent platform where every vote is immutable and every voter is verified, eliminating the risks of fraud and manipulation.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Admin-Only Candidate Registration**: Only the admin can add candidates.
- **One Person One Vote**: Each address can vote only once.
- **Election Control**: Admin can start and end elections.
- **Public Tallying**: Votes are stored transparently on-chain for anyone to verify.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Implement voter authentication with cryptographic proofs.
- Build a full-stack DApp frontend with React and Web3.js.
- Integrate IPFS for identity documents and candidate profiles.
- Support multiple elections and voting rounds.
- Add time constraints and event-based triggers.
